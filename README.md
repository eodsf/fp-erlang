Adopting Erlang book: https://adoptingerlang.org/
https://github.com/adoptingerlang/adoptingerlang
"Adopting Erlang is an ongoing effort to gather all the resources that will help you use Erlang in a business. The booksite is divided in three sections focusing particularly on Erlang/OTP’s higher level concepts in the current open source ecosystem, how to use it in production (while setting up a pipeline for continuous development and delivery), and how to build a team when you’re starting from scratch"

"
As an additional resource to the official docs, I cannot recommend the https://spawnedshelter.com/ enough; made by Federico Carrone (of https://notamonadtutorial.com/ fame) and Manuel Olmos. There you will find a curated list of tutorials, books (like Fred Hebert's and Simon Thompson's), videos, etc. on Erlang and the BEAM.

__Debugging__
One of the course participants highly recomments this debugger:
https://github.com/massemanet/redbug
"
Personally I don't agree that a debugger is not needed. When I'm working on someone else's code, which I do a lot, the first thing I do is install redbug (https://github.com/massemanet/redbug). It makes it very straightfoward to monitor what the code does in the real world and it's much much easier to use than the Erlang debug http://erlang.org/doc/man/dbg.html

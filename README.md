As an additional resource to the official docs, I cannot recommend the https://spawnedshelter.com/ enough; made by Federico Carrone (of https://notamonadtutorial.com/ fame) and Manuel Olmos. There you will find a curated list of tutorials, books (like Fred Hebert's and Simon Thompson's), videos, etc. on Erlang and the BEAM.
